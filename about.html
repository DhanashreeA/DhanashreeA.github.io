## About

Welcome to my webpage! First things first!

Who am I?
<small>My name is Dhanashree. I was born in India ( yes I like spicy food! ). I am passionate about technology. Apart from being a Software Engineer, I am a trained salsa dancer and an awesome cook (self proclaimed!). In my free time I like to eat!</small>

What do I do?
<small>I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University. It all started with my Undergarduate degree in Computer Engineering from Pune University.
 I got to experience handling real world problems when I worked for Tibco Software Ltd. from 2013-2015. My thirst for knowledge landed me an admit from ASU. Since then I have been pursuing my dream of becoming a better Software Engineer.</small>

What am I looking for?
<small>Summer Internships! I am interested in fields like software security and system programming the most.</small>
