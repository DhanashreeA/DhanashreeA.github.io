## About

 I am Dhanashree. I was born in India (pretty much a snake charmer! ;) ).
 I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University.I am passionate about technology.
 I am a trained salsa dancer and an awesome cook(self proclaimed!). In my free time I like to eat!
